# Distributed system project

For the distributed systems course given by the TuDelft we try to reproduce a distrubted systems algorithm that is described in the paper:  "Scalable and Secure Computation Among Strangers: Resource-Competitive Byzantine Protocol". 

Open this scala project in your IDE. The results of our experiments can be found in csv files. The analysis described in the paper can be found in the jupyter notebook. To recreate the results, run the main function.
